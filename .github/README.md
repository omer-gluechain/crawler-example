# GitHub Templates

This directory contains templates for GitHub issues and pull requests to standardize the format of contributions to the crawler-example project.

## Issue Templates

Two issue templates are provided:

1. **Bug Report**: For reporting bugs and unexpected behavior
2. **Feature Request**: For suggesting new features or enhancements

## Pull Request Template

The pull request template helps contributors provide all necessary information when submitting changes to the project, ensuring proper documentation and testing.

These templates align with the project's [contribution guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
