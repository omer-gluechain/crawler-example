# Repository Analysis: crawler-example

## Repository Structure

The crawler-example repository is organized as follows:

- **Root Directory**
  - `README.md`: Main documentation file with usage instructions
  - `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies (requests, beautifulsoup4)
  - `example.py`: Example script demonstrating the crawler usage
  - `crawler/`: Main package directory
    - `__init__.py`: Package initialization with version information
    - `crawler.py`: Core implementation of the WebCrawler class

## Code Style and Standards

From analyzing the existing codebase, the following coding standards are observed:

1. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive docstrings using Google-style format with Args/Returns sections
   - Clear module-level docstrings (e.g., in `__init__.py`)
   - Detailed inline comments explaining implementation details

2. **Python Conventions**:
   - Classes use PascalCase (e.g., `WebCrawler`)
   - Functions and variables use snake_case (e.g., `get_html`, `visited_urls`)
   - Constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (though none explicitly defined in the current codebase)
   - Clear function and variable naming that indicates purpose

3. **Code Organization**:
   - Logical separation of concerns (URL fetching, HTML parsing, crawling logic)
   - Clean class structure with clear method responsibilities
   - Command-line interface separated from core functionality

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Try-except blocks for handling request errors
   - Proper HTTP status code checking with `raise_for_status()`
   - Graceful error reporting

## Development Workflow

Based on the repository analysis and clarifying questions:

1. **Branching Strategy**:
   - Feature branches should follow the naming convention: `feature/bugfix-<feature-name>`

2. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Simple and following best practices (no specific framework identified)
   - Contributors should ensure proper testing of their code

3. **Code Style Enforcement**:
   - Follow the existing code style in the repository

## Contribution Needs

Areas where contributions would be beneficial:

1. **Functionality Enhancements**:
   - Support for JavaScript-rendered websites
   - Advanced URL filtering/pattern matching
   - Better link extraction from HTML content (currently minimal)
   - Rate limiting and robots.txt compliance

2. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Developer guides for extending the crawler
   - More usage examples

3. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for the crawler

4. **Code Quality**:
   - Type hints (currently not used)
   - More comprehensive error handling
   - Logging framework integration (currently uses print statements)

## Pull Request Guidelines

Based on repository needs:

1. PRs should focus on specific features or fixes
2. Code should maintain existing style conventions
3. New features should include appropriate documentation
4. Changes should be tested thoroughly

## Issue Reporting Requirements

Effective issue reports should include:

1. Clear description of the bug or feature request
2. Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
3. Expected vs. actual behavior (for bugs)
4. Version information
5. Relevant configuration details
